substra-cli
===========

*Substra CLI for interacting with substrabac*

Getting started
---------------

The substra cli depends on `substra-sdk-py`, this package is private and you will have to update your `pip.conf` for handling it.  
For this you need to have access to `https://substra-pypi.owkin.com/simple/`  
Ask our current Substra Pypi Server Manager for getting an account.  
You will then need to put in your newly created virtualenv path, a `pip.conf` file containing:
```
[global]
index-url = https://<user>:<pass>@substra-pypi.owkin.com/simple/
```


If you've cloned this project, and want to install the library (*and
all development dependencies*), the command you'll want to run is:

    $ pip install -e .[test]

If you'd like to run all tests for this project, you would run the following command:

    $ python setup.py test

This will trigger [py.test](http://pytest.org/latest/), along with its
popular [coverage](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-cov) plugin.

Usage

	$ substra --help

Autocompletion
--------------

Autocompletion files can be autogenerated by the tool [infi.docopt-completion](https://github.com/Infinidat/infi.docopt_completion/) for both bash and zsh shells.

Install it in your python virtual environment
```bash
pip install infi.docopt-completion
```

##### Bash

After installing substra as a binary, run:
``` bash
docopt-completion substra --manual-bash
Completion file written to ./substra.sh
```

Now move this file inside `/etc/bash_completion.d/`
```bash
sudo mv ./substra.sh /etc/bash_completion.d/
```
Then source it with `source /etc/bash_completion`  
You now can enjoy autocompletion :tada:

#### Zsh


After installing substra as a binary, run:
``` bash
docopt-completion substra --manual-zsh
Completion file written to ./_substra
```

Now move this file inside `/usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion`
```bash
sudo mv ./_substra /usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion
```
Then source it with `source ~/.zshrc`  
You now can enjoy autocompletion :tada:
